# Elevens 9

Follow the instructions provided for Activity 9 in the student lab guide. Complete the necessary methods and ensure that your game is running properly. You may need to run it from the command line to have it recognize the card graphics. Answer the questions below before you push the finalized repo.

## Questions
1. The size of the board is one of the differences between *Elevens* and *Thirteens*. Why is size not an abstract method?

    * It's used as an instance variable not a method.

2. Why are there no abstract methods dealing with the selection of the cards to be removed or replaced in the array `cards`?

    * Because selection of and removing of cards is implemented in the other methods (isLEgal)

3. Another way to create “IS-A” relationships is by implementing interfaces. Suppose that instead of creating an `abstract Board` class, we created the following `Board` interface, and had `ElevensBoard` implement it. Would this new scheme allow the Elevens GUI to call `isLegal` and `anotherPlayIsPossible` polymorphically? Would this alternate design work as well as the `abstract Board` class design? Why or why not?
	```java
	public interface Board {
	    boolean isLegal(List<Integer> selectedCards);
	    boolean anotherPlayIsPossible();
	}
	```

    * Yes, the ElevensGUI would be able to call both methods. In this case, it should work as well as the abstract Boards design because they perform the same function.
